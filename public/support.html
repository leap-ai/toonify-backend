    <h2>ðŸ’¡ Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>How do I cartoonify a photo?</strong><br>
    Upload any photo, select a style variant (like Ghibli or others), and our AI will transform it instantly.</p>

    <p><strong>What is Toonify Pro?</strong><br>
    Toonify Pro is our premium subscription that unlocks access to all cartoon style variants beyond the default Ghibli style. It offers weekly, monthly, and yearly plans. It also offers image credits for each plan as below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Weekly: 50 credits</li>
      <li>Monthly: 200 credits</li>
      <li>Yearly: Unlimited (1000) credits</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>How do I subscribe to Toonify Pro?</strong><br>
    You can subscribe directly within the app through the dedicated 'Subscription' tab or when trying to use a Pro-only variant. Purchases are processed securely via the Apple App Store.</p>

    <p><strong>How do I manage or cancel my subscription?</strong><br>
    Your Toonify Pro subscription is managed through your Apple App Store account. You can view, change, or cancel your subscription by going to your device's Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions.</p>

    <p><strong>How can I manage or delete my data?</strong><br>
    We provide several options for managing your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deleting Specific Generations:</strong> You can remove individual image generations directly from the "History" screen within the app. Deleting a generation permanently removes both the original image you uploaded for that generation and the resulting cartoon image from our systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Deleting Your Account:</strong> You can permanently delete your entire account and associated data through the "Profile" screen in the app. Please be aware that this action is irreversible. Once your account is deleted, it cannot be recovered.</li>
      <li><strong>Assisted Data Deletion Request:</strong> If you require assistance or have specific data deletion needs not covered above, please email our support team at <a href="mailto:support@toonify.pro">support@toonify.pro</a>, and we will process your request promptly, typically within 24 business hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What if I have an issue with a generated image?</strong><br>
    While our AI strives for high-quality results, variations can occur. If you encounter an unsatisfactory result, please feel free to try generating again. If you consistently face issues or believe there is a technical fault, please contact <a href="mailto:support@toonify.pro">support@toonify.pro</a> with details about the original image and the issue encountered.</p>
